## Software Experience

Over my 26 years I've amassed deep technical grasps for a number of programming language, each with their own comprehensive experiences. Below outlines the languages that I'm experienced in, where the experience is derived from, and associated frameworks or packages that I'm familiar with (keywords):

const Languages = {
  python: {

    keywords: [],

    level: "professional",
    keywords: [
      "typescript", "nodejs", "express", "react", "web3", "next.js",
